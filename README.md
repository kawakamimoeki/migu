# Migu

Migu is a plain Ruby code base migration tool for vector databases that lack a well-established migration mechanism.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add migu

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install migu

## Usage

```
$ migu help
Commands:
  migu generate NAME           # Generate migration file to migu/migrate/ directory
  migu init                    # Initialize Migu SQLite3 database. migu/state.sqlite3 will be created.
  migu ls                      # List migrations
  migu migrate                 # Migrate all migrations
  migu reset                   # Migu Reset
  migu rollback                # Rollback 1 migration
  migu version                 # Print version
```

### Init

Initialize Migu SQLite3 databse for managing migration states.

```
migu init
```

This command will create `migu/state.sqlite3`.

### Generate

Generate migration file to `migu/migrate/**.rb`.

```
migu generate create_users
```

### Define migration class

Example:

```ruby
class CreateUsers < Migu::Migration
  def self.time
    "2023-06-30 23:27:50 +0900" # Do not edit
  end

  def up
    client = Weaviate::Client.new
    client.schema.create(
      # ...
    )
  end

  def down
    client = Weaviate::Client.new
    client.schema.delete(
      # ...
    )
  end
end
```

## Define Hooks

Define hooks that is called before or after migration process.

`migu/config.rb`:

```ruby
Migu.configuration do |config|
  config.before do
    client = Weaviate::Client.new
    client.schema.list
  end

  config.after do
    client = Weaviate::Client.new
    client.schema.list
  end
end
```

This config file is generated by init command.

### Migrate

```
migu migrate
```

### Rollback

```
migu rollback
```

### List

```bash
$ migu ls
CreateUsers migrated
CreatePosts not_migrated
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
